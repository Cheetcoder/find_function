In this implementation, we define a `find_files()` function that uses `glob` to search for files in a directory and its subdirectories. The `name` argument is used to match filenames, and the `ftype` argument is used to filter by file type.

In the `main()` function, we parse command-line arguments using `argparse`, call `find_files()`, and print the results.

To find files in a directory and its subdirectories, run the script with the directory you want to search in as the first argument, and the name of the file you're looking for as the `--name` argument. For example, to find all files with the name `example.txt` in the directory `/path/to/directory`, use:

bashCopy code

`python find_files.py /path/to/directory --name "example.txt"`

To filter the search results by file type, use the `--type` argument followed by a single letter code. For example, to find all regular files with the extension `.txt` in the directory `/path/to/directory`, use:

bashCopy code

`python find_files.py /path/to/directory --name "*.txt" --type f`

This implementation provides a pure Python solution for finding files in a directory and its subdirectories with various filtering options.
